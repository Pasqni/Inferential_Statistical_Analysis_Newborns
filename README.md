# Inferential Statistical Analysis: Newborns' weight prediction

This project aims at predicting a newborn's weight, based on the knowledge of some variables related to the mother and the newborn itself.

The analysis was conducted using R and the output report is an HTML file obtained using RMarkdown.

We use the dataset present in the csv file. It contains data on 2500 newborns collected from 3 different hospitals, with 10 variables for each observation.

The influence of each variable on the response variable **Weight** has been studied, in order to create a *multiple linear regression model* to predict it. Various tests have been performed, such as *Correlation Test*, *Student T test* and *Chi Square Test*, to verify various hypotesis. Intensive use of `ggplot2` and its submodules has been made for data visulization.
